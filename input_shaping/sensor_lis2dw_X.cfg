# This file contains common pin mappings for the bigtreetech lis2dw v1.0
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# RP2040 with "USB"
# The micro-controller will be used to control the components on the nozzle.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

#axes_map: -y,x,-z # ORG

#axes_map: x, y, z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's X, Y, and Z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".



[resonance_tester]
probe_points: 117.5, 117.5, 120
accel_chip: lis2dw



#probe_points:
#   A list of X, Y, Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
#accel_chip:
#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
#accel_chip_x:
#accel_chip_y:
#   Names of the accelerometer chips to use for measurements for each
#   of the axis. Can be useful, for instance, on bed slinger printer,
#   if two separate accelerometers are mounted on the bed (for Y axis)
#   and on the toolhead (for X axis). These parameters have the same
#   format as 'accel_chip' parameter. Only 'accel_chip' or these two
#   parameters must be provided.
#max_smoothing:
#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
#   maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
#   for more details on using this feature.
#min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
#max_freq: 133.33
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.
#accel_per_hz: 75
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
